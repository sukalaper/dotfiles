Before, sorry for my bad english.

In some time and also due to some factors finally I changed my machine from X220 to T460 and had to adjust some settings like `BAT0`, `Backlight`, `Wireless`, `Font`, etc. **I will finish everything asap**.

In this screenshot you will see the font I use is Cozette, I like Bitmap fonts like Cozette but unfortunately it's too small so sometimes I have trouble reading it until I finally went back to using Iosevka.


EOL.
